# Insurance Rater Agent Challenge

This starter bundle contains the source files needed to build and test the challenge locally. The completed submission must also meet the hosted frontend, browser upload, and saved-run history requirements in `challenge.md`.

## Contents

- `challenge.md` - domain primer, complete task, output contract, evaluation criteria and submission instructions.
- `sample-policies/` - four de-identified motor-policy PDFs, including an HDFC ERGO comprehensive policy and a Go Digit stand-alone TP policy.
- `raters/` - the four matching original-format brokerage grids: three XLSX workbooks and one PDF.
- `MANIFEST.json` - SHA-256 checksum and byte size for every bundled file.

Start with the OD/TP and commission-grid primer in `challenge.md`, then point your implementation at a file under `sample-policies/` and the local `raters/` directory. Treat the commission grids as authoritative and do not hard-code answers for the supplied policies.

The workbook and PDF metadata in this bundle has been sanitized. The original grid layouts, formulas, cached values, sheets and lookup content are retained.
